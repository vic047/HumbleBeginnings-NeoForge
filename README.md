Humble Beginnings
=====

## Basic Information
This mod forces the player, to use the correct tools, to break a block. This means you'll need an axe to break wood! Fortunately this mod also adds an primitive axe, more on this under the "Wood Working" category.
Also this mod changes, how you obtain certain items. For leather, you now need to get animal skin and process it. More on this under "Leather Working".
Ultimately, the goal is to make the game more realistic in the scope of minecraft. This mod is only one small part of a modpack, I am working on

## Wood Working
- Get sticks from leaves (drop chance is increased).
- Craft a "Poke Stick".
- Right-Click with it on gravel for a chance to get sharp flint.
- Craft a Primitive Axe from sticks and a sharp flint.
- Harvest a tree with the axe to get logs.
- Craft a log with the axe to two planks.
- To get four logs you'll need a saw.


## Leather Working
- Gather skin from animals drops
- Gather bark by stripping log
- Get sharp flint by right-clicking with flint on a solid surface
- Create tanning compound with bark and sharp flint or in cutting board (Farmer's Delight)
- Scrape the skin with a sharp flint to get raw hide
- Craft a tanning barrel
- Right-Click it with a tanning compound and add water afterwards (barrel will also fill with rain)
- When the barrel is filled, right-click it with a raw hide to get soaked hide
- Hang the soaked hide on the drying rack and wait for five minutes
- The hide will be dried and you will have normal, vanilla leather
